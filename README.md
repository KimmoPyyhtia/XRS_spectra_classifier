# XRS_spectra_classifier
My Master's thesis code and data. This program creates a training set for XRS-spectra and uses a Support Vector Machine and a Neural Network to classify the spectra that have scattered from the sample instead of the background.


The raw data must be downloaded from my personal Google Drive folder. Here's the link to the files https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nd98b1RHQMu7ssuTLjX1voDiStgDCPMQ?usp=sharing . The files were too large to be added to GitHub directly.
